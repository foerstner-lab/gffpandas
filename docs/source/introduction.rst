What is gffpandas?
##################

| gffpandas is a Python library, which can be used for annotation data. It facilitates the work with gff3 files in regard to filter desired annotation entries of the gff3 file. Thereby, it is an easy to use and time-saving library.

| This gffpandas library is an alternative to gffutils or bcbio-gff, but it is inspired by the Python library pandas. This means that the data frame structure is used to work with the annotation data, because gffpandas reads in the gff3 file and makes a data frame out of it. With gffpandas it is possible to filter a gff3 file by different functions. Another big advantage is that several filter functions can be combined so that the required annotation entries can be selected. Furthermore, can the filtered annotation data be safed again as gff3 file or as csv or tsv file.
